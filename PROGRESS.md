# PROGRESS for Arcade Mode

## Monday 1/22/17:
### Tim:
  - @:
    - [ ] Gulp v4 broke a lot of things that need fixing.
    - [ ] Running test via webworker does not work in dev, but works in prod build.
    - [ ] Random unit tests are failing.

## Thursday 6/29/17:
### Tim:
  - @:
    - [ ] QOL change: Users want to press back to return to the menu, but instead end up leaving the site altogether.
      1. A prompt is needed on pressing the back button as to not lose all progress.
      2. Client-side history management is needed.
        - Considerations:
          - history.pushState
          - react-router

## Monday 6/26/17:
### Tim:
  - Progress:
    1. Add challenges:
      - Circles of given radius through two points
      - Closest-pair program
      - 24 game
  - @:
    - [ ] 24 game benchmark takes 40s due to inefficiency of solution.
    - [ ] Empty benchmarks generate an empty array, which outputs an error to console.
    - [ ] Scrolling quickly on the CodeMirror editor causes the window to change in size during the event.

## Friday 6/23/17:
### Tim:
  - Progress:
    1. Add challenges:
      - Averages--Mode
      - Averages--Pythagorean means
      - Averages--Root mean squares
      - Babbage problem
      - Balanced brackets

## Thursday 6/22/17:
### Tim:
  - Progress:
    1. Finalize RosettaCode task extraction/processing script.
    1. Add raw files back to version control due to unknown API rate limiting.

## Wednesday 6/21/17:
### Tim:
  - Progress:
    1. Continue improvements on RosettaCode task extraction/processing script.
      - script only fetches from endpoint when raw/ dir nonexistent. Use --force otherwise.
    2. Remove raw files from version control.
    3. Update challenges to current task processing output.
  - @:
    - [ ] Make cache busting update to latest on first page load instead of the second refresh.

## Tuesday 6/20/17:
### Tim:
  - Progress:
    1. Further improve upon RosettaCode task extraction/parsing script.
    2. Add Google spreadsheet to keep track of and make notes of task conversion process: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b_wMIaKR-gA0tD6ADQfDjDT5BBWaUsQyIPP0TS6o7is/edit?usp=sharing
    3. Add 24 game challenge (WIP).
    4. Add 9 billion names of God the integer challenge.
    5. Add Amicable pairs challenge.
    6. Update build process following an npm install.
  - @:
    - [X] Newline spaces are added to text nodes that follow any div HTML element.

## Monday 6/19/17:

## Saturday 6/17/17:
### Tim:
  - Progress:
    1. Add Align Columns challenge
  - @:
    - [ ] Pressing enter in already max-height CodeMirror editor (with scrollbar) does not auto scroll the newline into view. Need Vim scrolloff equivalent for Codemirror editor.

### Tuomas:
  - Progress:
      1. Created unit tests for Rosetta challenges. Can be run using 'npm run
         test:rosetta'. Tests use runner.js for quickly checking that they run
         correctly in Arcade mode environment.
      2. Added Zhang-suen thinning algorith.

## Friday 6/16/17:
### Tim:
  - Progress:
    1. Add MathJax for mathematical equation rendering.
  - @:
    - [ ] main.bundle.js failed to fetch in a different environment; displays old version despite updates. Cache refreshed and pushed still required two page refreshes to resolve to current iteration.
    - [ ] Static copy of MathJax currently unusable due to its use of non-`strict mode` code. Currently serving from cdnjs, which involves the possibility of retrieval failure during offline sessions.

## Wednesday 6/14/17:
### Tim:
  - Progress:
    1. Update workflow to auto generate Rosetta JSON from proper dir.
    2. Rework first RosettaCode task into Rosetta challenge - 100 doors.
  - @:
    - [ ] Conventurist time-based assertion tests capable of returning different results/run.
    - [ ] 100 doors challenge stock solution? Efficient solution requires seeing the mathematical pattern.
