/// description:
/// <div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">The classical eight queens puzzle is the well known problem of placing eight chess queens on a 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Allowing configurations to reappear in rotated or mirrored form, a total of 92 distinct configurations can be found for eight queens. The general case asks for the number of distinct ways of placing n queens on a n×n board, e.g. you can find 2 distinct configurations for n=4.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Lets define a weak queen on a n×n board to be a piece which can move any number of squares if moved horizontally, but a maximum of n−1−w squares if moved vertically or diagonally, 0≤w<n being the "weakness factor". For example, a weak queen on a n×n board with a weakness factor of w=1 located in the bottom row will not be able to threaten any square in the top row as the weak queen would need to move n−1 squares vertically or diagonally to get there, but may only move n−2 squares in these directions. In contrast, the weak queen is not handicapped horizontally, thus threatening every square in its own row, independently from its current position in that row.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Let Q(n,w) be the number of ways n weak queens with weakness factor w can be placed on a n×n board so that no two queens threaten each other. It can be shown, for example, that Q(4,0)=2, Q(4,2)=16 and Q(4,3)=256.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Let $S(n)=\displaystyle\sum_{w=0}^{n-1} Q(n,w)$.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">You are given that S(4)=276 and S(5)=3347.</p>
