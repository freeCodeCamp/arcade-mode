/// description:
/// <div class="euler"><p class="euler__paragraph">A group of chefs (numbered #1, #2, etc) participate in a turn-based strategic cooking competition. On each chef's turn, he/she cooks up a dish to the best of his/her ability and gives it to a separate panel of judges for taste-testing. Let S(k) represent chef #k's skill level (which is publicly known). More specifically, S(k) is the probability that chef #k's dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on any/all turns). If the dish receives a favorable rating, then the chef must choose one other chef to be eliminated from the competition. The last chef remaining in the competition is the winner.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">The game always begins with chef #1, with the turn order iterating sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is always the one with the next-closest turn.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Define Wn(k) as the probability that chef #k wins in a competition with n chefs. If we have S(1) = 0.25, S(2) = 0.5, and S(3) = 1, then W3(1) = 0.29375.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Going forward, we assign S(k) = Fk/Fn+1 over all 1 ≤ k ≤ n, where Fk is a Fibonacci number: Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 with base cases F1 = F2 = 1. Then, for example, when considering a competition with n = 7 chefs, we have W7(1) = 0.08965042, W7(2) = 0.20775702, W7(3) = 0.15291406, W7(4) = 0.14554098, W7(5) = 0.15905291, W7(6) = 0.10261412, and W7(7) = 0.14247050, rounded to 8 decimal places each.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Let E(n) represent the expected number of dishes cooked in a competition with n chefs. For instance, E(7) = 42.28176050.</p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph"></p>
/// <p class="euler__paragraph">Find E(14) rounded to 8 decimal places.</p></div>
