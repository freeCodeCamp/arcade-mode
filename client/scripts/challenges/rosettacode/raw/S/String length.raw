;Task:
Find the <em>character</em> and <em>byte</em> length of a string.
 
This means encodings like [[UTF-8]] need to be handled properly, as there is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship between bytes and characters. 

By <span class="rosetta__text--italic">character</span>, we mean an individual Unicode <span class="rosetta__text--italic">code point</span>, not a user-visible <span class="rosetta__text--italic">grapheme</span> containing combining characters. 

For example, the character length of "møøse" is 5 but the byte length is 7 in UTF-8 and 10 in UTF-16.

Non-BMP code points (those between 0x10000 and 0x10FFFF) must also be handled correctly: answers should produce actual character counts in code points, not in code unit counts. 

Therefore a string like "𝔘𝔫𝔦𝔠𝔬𝔡𝔢" (consisting of the 7 Unicode characters U+1D518  U+1D52B U+1D526 U+1D520 U+1D52C U+1D521 U+1D522) is 7 characters long, <span class="rosetta__text--bold">not</span> 14 UTF-16 code units; and it is 28 bytes long whether encoded in UTF-8 or in  UTF-16.  

Please mark your examples with <nowiki>===Character Length=== or ===Byte Length===</nowiki>. 

If your language is capable of providing the string length in graphemes, mark those examples with <nowiki>===Grapheme Length===</nowiki>.  

For example, the string "J̲o̲s̲é̲" ("J\x{332}o\x{332}s\x{332}e\x{301}\x{332}") has 4 user-visible graphemes, 9 characters (code points), and 14 bytes when encoded in UTF-8.

=={{header|JavaScript}}==
===Byte Length===
JavaScript encodes strings in UTF-16, which represents each character with one or two 16-bit values. The length property of string objects gives the number of 16-bit values used to encode a string, so the number of bytes can be determined by doubling that number.

<lang javascript>var s = "Hello, world!";
var byteCount = s.length * 2; //26</lang>
===Character Length===
JavaScript encodes strings in UTF-16, which represents each character with one or two 16-bit values. The most commonly used characters are represented by one 16-bit value, while rarer ones like some mathematical symbols are represented by two.

JavaScript has no built-in way to determine how many characters are in a string. However, if the string only contains commonly used characters, the number of characters will be equal to the number of 16-bit values used to represent the characters.
<lang javascript>var str1 = "Hello, world!";
var len1 = str1.length; //13

var str2 = "\uD834\uDD2A"; //U+1D12A represented by a UTF-16 surrogate pair
var len2 = str2.length; //2</lang>
