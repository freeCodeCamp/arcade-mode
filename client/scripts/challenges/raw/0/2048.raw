2048

{{task|Games}}Implement a 2D sliding block puzzle game where blocks with numbers are combined to add their values.

The rules are that each turn the player must perform a valid move shifting all tiles in one direction (up, down, left or right). A move is valid when at least one tile can be moved in that direction. When moved against each other tiles with the same number on them combine into one. A new tile with the value of 2 is spawned at the end of each turn if there is an empty spot for it. To win the player must create a tile with the number 2048. The player loses if no valid moves are possible.

The name comes from the popular open-source implementation of this game mechanic, [https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ 2048].

Requirements:
* "Non-greedy" movement. The tiles that were created by combining other tiles should not be combined again during the same turn (move). That is to say that moving the tile row of

  [2][2][2][2]

to the right should result in 

  ......[4][4]

and not

  .........[8]

* "Move direction priority". If more than one variant of combining is possible, move direction shows one that will take effect. For example, moving the tile row of

  ...[2][2][2]

to the right should result in

  ......[2][4]

and not

  ......[4][2]

* Adding a new tile on a blank space. Most of the time new "2" is to be added and occasionally (10% of the time) - "4"
* Check for valid moves. The player shouldn't be able to skip their turn by trying a move that doesn't change the board.
* Win condition.
* Lose condition.
