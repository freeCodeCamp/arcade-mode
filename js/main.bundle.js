Given an array of unsorted items, we want to be able to return a sorted array. We will see several different methods to do this and learn some tradeoffs between these different approaches. While most modern languages have built-in sorting methods for operations like this, it is still important to understand some of the common basic approaches and learn how they can be implemented.","Here we will see bubble sort. The bubble sort method starts at the beginning of an unsorted array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted. It does this by comparing adjacent items and swapping them if they are out of order.

It takes advantage of the fact that it is relatively easy to sort two arrays as long as each is sorted in the first place. But we'll start with only one array as input, so how do we get to two sorted arrays from that? Well, we can recursively divide the original input in two until we reach the base case of an array with one item. A single-item array is naturally sorted, so then we can start combining. This combination will unwind the recursive calls that split the original array, eventually producing a final sorted array of all the elements. The steps of merge sort, then, are:","<strong>1)</strong> Recursively split the input array in half until a sub-array with only one element is produced.","<strong>2)</strong> Merge each sorted sub-array together to produce the final sorted array.","Merge sort is an efficient sorting method, with time complexity of <i>O(nlog(n))</i>.

A Hash table is used to implement associative arrays, or mappings of key-value pairs, like the objects and Maps we have just been studying. A JavaScript object could be implemented as a hash table, for instance (its actual implementation will depend on the environment it's running in). The way a hash table works is that it takes a key input and hashes this key in a deterministic way to some numerical value. This numerical value is then used as the actual key the associated value is stored by. Then, if you try to access the same key again, the hashing function will process the key, return the same numerical result, which will then be used to look up the associated value. This provides very efficient O(n) lookup time on average.","Hash tables can be implemented as arrays with hash functions producing array indices within a specified range. In this method, the choice of the array size is important, as is the hashing function. For instance, what if the hashing function produces the same value for two different keys? This is called a collision. One way to handle collisions is to just store both key-value pairs at that index. Then, upon lookup of either, you would have to iterate through the bucket of items to find the key you are looking for. A good hashing function will minimize collisions to maintain efficient search time.","Here, we won't be concerned with the details of hashing or hash table implementation, we will just try to get a general sense of how they work.","Instructions: Let's create the basic functionality of a hash table. We've created a naive hashing function for you to use. You can pass a string value to the function hash and it will return a hashed value you can use as a key for storage. Store items based on this hashed value in the this.collection object. Create these three methods: add, remove, and lookup. The first should accept a key value pair to add to the hash table. The second should remove a key-value pair when passed a key. The third should accept a key and return the associated value or null if the key is not present.","Be sure to write your code to account for collisions!"],head:["  var called = 0;","    var hash = (string) => {","     called++;","      var hash = 0;","      for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) { hash += string.charCodeAt(i); };","      return hash;","    };"],challengeSeed:["var called = 0;","var hash = (string) => {","  called++;","  var hash = 0;","  for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) { hash += string.charCodeAt(i); }","  return hash;","};","var HashTable = function() {","  this.collection = {};","  // change code below this line","  // change code above this line","};"],tests:["assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof HashTable !== 'undefined') { test = new HashTable() }; return (typeof test === 'object')})(), 'message: The HashTable data structure exists.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof HashTable !== 'undefined') { test = new HashTable() }; return ((typeof test.add) === 'function')})(), 'message: The HashTable has an add method.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof HashTable !== 'undefined') { test = new HashTable() }; return ((typeof test.remove) === 'function')})(), 'message: The HashTable has an remove method.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof HashTable !== 'undefined') { test = new HashTable() }; return ((typeof test.lookup) === 'function')})(), 'message: The HashTable has an lookup method.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof HashTable !== 'undefined') { test = new HashTable() }; test.add('key', 'value'); return (test.lookup('key') === 'value')})(), 'message: The add method adds key value pairs and the lookup method returns the values associated with a given key.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof HashTable !== 'undefined') { test = new HashTable() }; test.add('key', 'value'); test.remove('key'); return (test.lookup('key') === null)})(), 'message: The remove method accepts a key as input and removes the associated key value pair.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof HashTable !== 'undefined') { test = new HashTable() }; called = 0; test.add('key1','value1'); test.add('key2','value2'); test.add('key3','value3'); return (called === 3)})(), 'message: Items are added using the hash function.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof HashTable !== 'undefined') { test = new HashTable() }; called = 0; test.add('key1','value1'); test.add('1key','value2'); test.add('ke1y','value3'); return (test.lookup('key1') === 'value1' && test.lookup('1key') == 'value2' && test.lookup('ke1y') == 'value3')})(), 'message: The hash table handles collisions.');"],type:"waypoint",releasedOn:"Feb 17, 2017",solutions:[],challengeType:1,translations:{}},{id:"587d8251367417b2b2512c61",title:"Work with Nodes in a Linked List",description:["Another common data structure you'll run into in computer science is the <dfn>linked list</dfn>.

Trees are an important and versatile data structure in computer science. Of course, their name comes from the fact that when visualized they look much like the trees we are familiar with in the natural world. A tree data structure begins with one node, typically referred to as the root, and from here branches out to additional nodes, each of which may have more child nodes, and so on and so forth. The data structure is usually visualized with the root node at the top; you can think of it as a natural tree flipped upside down.","First, let's describe some common terminology we will encounter with trees. The root node is the top of the tree. Data points in the tree are called nodes. Nodes with branches leading to other nodes are referred to as the parent of the node the branch leads to (the child). Other more complicated familial terms apply as you might expect. A subtree refers to all the descendants of a particular node, branches may be referred to as edges, and leaf nodes are nodes at the end of the tree that have no children. Finally, note that trees are inherently recursive data structures. That is, any children of a node are parents of their own subtree, and so on. The recursive nature of trees is important to understand when designing algorithms for common tree operations.","To begin, we will discuss a particular type of a tree, the binary tree. In fact, we will actually discuss a particular binary tree, a binary search tree. Let's describe what this means. While the tree data structure can have any number of branches at a single node, a binary tree can only have two branches for every node. Furthermore, a binary search tree is ordered with respective to the child subtrees, such that each left subtree is less than or equal to the parent node, and each right subtree is greater than or equal to the parent node. Binary search trees are very common and useful data structures because they provide logarithmic time in the average case for several common operations such as lookup, insertion, and deletion.","Instructions: We'll start simple. We've defined the skeleton of a binary search tree structure here in addition to a function to create nodes for our tree. Observe that each node may have a left and right value. These will be assigned child subtrees if they exist. In our binary search tree, define two methods,","findMin and findMax. These methods should return the minimum and maximum value held in the binary search tree. If you get stuck, reflect on the invariant that must be true for binary search trees: each left subtree is less than or equal to its parent and each right subtree is greater than or equal to","its parent.

Binary search trees provide logarithmic time for the common operations of lookup, insertion, and deletion in the average case, and linear time in the worst case. Why is this? Each of those basic operations requires us to find an item in the tree (or in the case of insertion to find where it should go) and because of the tree structure at each parent node we are branching left or right and effectively excluding half the size of the remaining tree. This makes the search proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes in the tree, which creates logarithmic time for these operations in the average case.","Ok, but what about the worst case? Well, consider constructing a tree from the following values, adding them left to right: 10, 12, 17, 25. Following our rules for a binary search tree, we will add 12 to the right of 10, 17 to the right of this, and 25 to the right of this. Now our tree resembles a linked list and traversing it to find 25 would require us to traverse all the items in linear fashion. Hence, linear time in the worst case. The problem here is that the tree is unbalanced. We'll look a little more into what this means in the following challenges.","Instructions: In this challenge, we will create a utility for our tree.

To understand the concept of balance, let's take a look at another tree property: height. Height in a tree represents the distance from the root node to any given leaf node. Different paths in a highly branched tree structure may have different heights, but for a given tree there will be a minimum and maximum height. If the tree is balanced, these values will differ at most by one. This means that in a balanced tree, all the leaf nodes exist within the same level, or if they are not within the same level they are at most one level apart.","The property of balance is important for trees because it is what determines the efficiency of tree operations. As we explained in the last challenge, we face worst case time complexity for heavily unbalanced trees. Self-balancing trees are commonly used to account for this issue in trees with dynamic data sets. Common examples of these include AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees. These trees all contain additional internal logic which re-balance the tree when insertions or deletions create a state of imbalance.","Note: A similar property to height is depth, which refers to how far a given node is from the root node.","Instructions: Write two methods for our binary tree: findMinHeight and findMaxHeight.

Deletion is difficult because removing nodes breaks links in the tree. These links must be carefully reestablished to ensure the binary tree structure is maintained. For some deletions, this means the tree must be rearranged. In general, you will encounter one of three cases when trying to delete a node:","Leaf Node: The target to delete has zero children.","One Child: The target to delete only has one child.","Two Children: The target to delete has two child nodes.","Removing a leaf node is easy, we simply remove it. Deleting a node with one child is also relatively easy, we simply remove it and link its parent to child of the node we deleted. Removing a node with two children is more difficult, however, because this creates two child nodes that need to be reconnected to the parent tree. We'll see how to deal with this case in the third challenge. Additionally, you need to be mindful of some edge cases when handling deletion. What if the tree is empty? What if the node to delete is the root node? What if there are only two elements in the tree? For now, let's handle the first case where we delete a leaf node.","Instructions: Create a method on our binary tree called remove. We'll build the logic for our deletion operation in here. First, you'll want to create a function within remove that finds the node we are trying to delete in the current tree. If the node is not present in the tree, remove should return null. Now, if the target node is a leaf node with no children, then the parent reference to it should be set to null. This effectively deletes the node from the tree. To do this, you will have to keep track of","the parent of the node we are trying to delete as well. It will also be useful to create a way to track the number of children the target node has, as this will determine which case our deletion falls under.","We will handle the second and third cases in the next challenges.

Removing a node like this produces two subtrees that are no longer connected to the original tree structure. How can we reconnect them? One method is to find the smallest value in the right subtree of the target node and replace the target node with this value. Selecting the replacement in this way ensures that it is greater than every node in the left subtree it becomes the new parent of but also less than every node in the right subtree it becomes the new parent of.","Once this replacement is made the replacement node must be removed from the right subtree. Even this operation is tricky because the replacement may be a leaf or it may itself be the parent of a right subtree. If it is a leaf we must remove its parent's reference to it. Otherwise, it must be the right child of the target. In this case, we must replace the target value with the replacement value and make the target reference the replacement's right child.","Instructions: Let's finish our remove method by handling the third case.

Instead, the path to a node represents a specific key. For instance, if we wanted to store the string code in a trie, we would have four nodes, one for each letter: c — o — d — e. Following that path through all these nodes will then create code as a string — that path is the key we stored. Then, if we wanted to add the string coding, it would share the first three nodes of code before branching away after the d. In this way, large datasets can be stored very compactly. In addition, search can be very quick because it is effectively limited to the length of the string you are storing. Furthermore, unlike binary trees a node can store any number of child nodes.","As you might have guessed from the above example, some metadata is commonly stored at nodes that hold the end of a key so that on later traversals that key can still be retrieved. For instance, if we added codes in our example above we would need some way to know that the e in code represents the end of a key that was previously entered. Otherwise, this information would effectively be lost when we add codes.","Instructions: Let's create a trie to store words.

A binary heap is a partially ordered binary tree which satisfies the heap property. The heap property specifies a relationship between parent and child nodes. You may have a max heap, in which all parent nodes are greater than or equal to their child nodes, or a min heap, in which the reverse is true. Binary heaps are also complete binary trees. This means that all levels of the tree are fully filled and if the last level is partially filled it is filled from left to right.","While binary heaps may be implemented as tree structures with nodes that contain left and right references, the partial ordering according to the heap property allows us to represent the heap with an array. The parent-children relationship is what we're interested in and with simple arithmetic we can compute the children of any parent and the parent of any child node.","For instance, consider this array representation of a binary max heap:","<code>[ 76, 63, 48, 42, 37, 6, 42, 22 ]</code>","The root node is the first element, 6. Its children are 22 and 30. If we look at the relationship between the array indices of these values, for index i the children are 2 * i + 1 and 2 * i + 2. Similarly, the element at index 0 is the parent of these two children at indices 1 and 2. More generally, we can find the parent of a node at any index with the following: i - 1 / 2. These patterns will hold true as the binary tree grows to any size. Finally, we can make a slight adjustment to make this arithmetic even easier by skipping the first element in the array. Doing this creates the following relationship for any element at a given index i:","Example Array representation: <code>[ null, 76, 63, 48, 42, 37, 6, 42, 22 ]</code>","An element's left child: i * 2","An element's right child: i * 2 + 1","An element's parent: i / 2","Once you wrap your head around the math, using an array representation is very useful because node locations can be quickly determined with this arithmetic and memory usage is diminished because you don't need to maintain references to child nodes.","Instructions: Here we will create a max heap.

Once the queue is full, new media data simply begins to overwrite old data.","A good way to illustrate this concept is with an array:","<blockquote>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br> ^Read @ 0<br> ^Write @ 0</blockquote>","Here the read and write are both at position <code>0</code>. Now the queue gets 3 new records <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>. Our queue now looks like:","<blockquote>[a, b, c, 4, 5]<br> ^Read @ 0<br>       ^Write @ 3</blockquote>","As the read head reads, it can remove values or keep them:","<blockquote>[null, null, null, 4, 5]<br>                   ^Read @ 3<br>                   ^Write @ 3</blockquote>","Once the write reaches the end of the array it loops back to the beginning:","<blockquote>[f, null, null, d, e]<br>                ^Read @ 3<br> ^Write @ 1</blockquote>","This approach requires a constant amount of memory but allows files of a much larger size to be processed.","Instructions:","In this challenge we will implement a circular queue. The circular queue should provide <code>enqueue</code> and <code>dequeue</code> methods which allow you to read from and write to the queue. The class itself should also accept an integer which you can use to specify the size of the queue when you create it. We've written the starting version of this class for you in the code editor. When you enqueue items to the queue, the write pointer should advance forward and loop back to the beginning once it reaches the end of the queue. Likewise, the read pointer should advance forward as you dequeue items. The write pointer should not be allowed to move past the read pointer (our class won't let you overwrite data you haven't read yet) and the read pointer should not be able to advance past data you have written.","In addition, the <code>enqueue</code> method should return the item you enqueued if it is successfully and otherwise return <code>null</code>. Similarly, when you dequeue an item it should be returned and if you cannot dequeue you should return <code>null</code>."],challengeSeed:["class CircularQueue {","   constructor(size) {","","     this.queue = [];","     this.read = 0;","     this.write = 0;","     this.max = size - 1;","","     while (size > 0) {","        this.queue.push(null);","        size--;","     }","","   }","","   print() {","     return this.queue;","   }","","","   enqueue(item) {","    // Only change code below this line","","    // Only change code above this line","   }","","   dequeue() {","    // Only change code below this line","","    // Only change code above this line","   }","}"],

A Hash table is used to implement associative arrays, or mappings of key-value pairs, like the objects and Maps we have just been studying. A JavaScript object could be implemented as a hash table, for instance (its actual implementation will depend on the environment it's running in). The way a hash table works is that it takes a key input and hashes this key in a deterministic way to some numerical value. This numerical value is then used as the actual key the associated value is stored by. Then, if you try to access the same key again, the hashing function will process the key, return the same numerical result, which will then be used to look up the associated value. This provides very efficient O(n) lookup time on average.","Hash tables can be implemented as arrays with hash functions producing array indices within a specified range. In this method, the choice of the array size is important, as is the hashing function. For instance, what if the hashing function produces the same value for two different keys? This is called a collision. One way to handle collisions is to just store both key-value pairs at that index. Then, upon lookup of either, you would have to iterate through the bucket of items to find the key you are looking for. A good hashing function will minimize collisions to maintain efficient search time.","Here, we won't be concerned with the details of hashing or hash table implementation, we will just try to get a general sense of how they work.","Instructions: Let's create the basic functionality of a hash table. We've created a naive hashing function for you to use. You can pass a string value to the function hash and it will return a hashed value you can use as a key for storage. Store items based on this hashed value in the this.collection object. Create these three methods: add, remove, and lookup. The first should accept a key value pair to add to the hash table. The second should remove a key-value pair when passed a key.

Trees are an important and versatile data structure in computer science. Of course, their name comes from the fact that when visualized they look much like the trees we are familiar with in the natural world. A tree data structure begins with one node, typically referred to as the root, and from here branches out to additional nodes, each of which may have more child nodes, and so on and so forth. The data structure is usually visualized with the root node at the top; you can think of it as a natural tree flipped upside down.","First, let's describe some common terminology we will encounter with trees. The root node is the top of the tree. Data points in the tree are called nodes. Nodes with branches leading to other nodes are referred to as the parent of the node the branch leads to (the child). Other more complicated familial terms apply as you might expect. A subtree refers to all the descendants of a particular node, branches may be referred to as edges, and leaf nodes are nodes at the end of the tree that have no children. Finally, note that trees are inherently recursive data structures. That is, any children of a node are parents of their own subtree, and so on. The recursive nature of trees is important to understand when designing algorithms for common tree operations.","To begin, we will discuss a particular type of a tree, the binary tree. In fact, we will actually discuss a particular binary tree, a binary search tree. Let's describe what this means. While the tree data structure can have any number of branches at a single node, a binary tree can only have two branches for every node. Furthermore, a binary search tree is ordered with respective to the child subtrees, such that each left subtree is less than or equal to the parent node, and each right subtree is greater than or equal to the parent node. Binary search trees are very common and useful data structures because they provide logarithmic time in the average case for several common operations such as lookup, insertion, and deletion.","Instructions: We'll start simple. We've defined the skeleton of a binary search tree structure here in addition to a function to create nodes for our tree. Observe that each node may have a left and right value. These will be assigned child subtrees if they exist. In our binary search tree, define two methods,","findMin and findMax. These methods should return the minimum and maximum value held in the binary search tree. If you get stuck, reflect on the invariant that must be true for binary search trees: each left subtree is less than or equal to its parent and each right subtree is greater than or equal to","its parent.

Binary search trees provide logarithmic time for the common operations of lookup, insertion, and deletion in the average case, and linear time in the worst case. Why is this? Each of those basic operations requires us to find an item in the tree (or in the case of insertion to find where it should go) and because of the tree structure at each parent node we are branching left or right and effectively excluding half the size of the remaining tree. This makes the search proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes in the tree, which creates logarithmic time for these operations in the average case.","Ok, but what about the worst case? Well, consider constructing a tree from the following values, adding them left to right: 10, 12, 17, 25. Following our rules for a binary search tree, we will add 12 to the right of 10, 17 to the right of this, and 25 to the right of this. Now our tree resembles a linked list and traversing it to find 25 would require us to traverse all the items in linear fashion. Hence, linear time in the worst case. The problem here is that the tree is unbalanced. We'll look a little more into what this means in the following challenges.","Instructions: In this challenge, we will create a utility for our tree.

To understand the concept of balance, let's take a look at another tree property: height. Height in a tree represents the distance from the root node to any given leaf node. Different paths in a highly branched tree structure may have different heights, but for a given tree there will be a minimum and maximum height. If the tree is balanced, these values will differ at most by one. This means that in a balanced tree, all the leaf nodes exist within the same level, or if they are not within the same level they are at most one level apart.","The property of balance is important for trees because it is what determines the efficiency of tree operations. As we explained in the last challenge, we face worst case time complexity for heavily unbalanced trees. Self-balancing trees are commonly used to account for this issue in trees with dynamic data sets. Common examples of these include AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees. These trees all contain additional internal logic which re-balance the tree when insertions or deletions create a state of imbalance.","Note: A similar property to height is depth, which refers to how far a given node is from the root node.","Instructions: Write two methods for our binary tree: findMinHeight and findMaxHeight.

Deletion is difficult because removing nodes breaks links in the tree. These links must be carefully reestablished to ensure the binary tree structure is maintained. For some deletions, this means the tree must be rearranged. In general, you will encounter one of three cases when trying to delete a node:","Leaf Node: The target to delete has zero children.","One Child: The target to delete only has one child.","Two Children: The target to delete has two child nodes.","Removing a leaf node is easy, we simply remove it. Deleting a node with one child is also relatively easy, we simply remove it and link its parent to child of the node we deleted. Removing a node with two children is more difficult, however, because this creates two child nodes that need to be reconnected to the parent tree. We'll see how to deal with this case in the third challenge. Additionally, you need to be mindful of some edge cases when handling deletion. What if the tree is empty? What if the node to delete is the root node? What if there are only two elements in the tree? For now, let's handle the first case where we delete a leaf node.","Instructions: Create a method on our binary tree called remove. We'll build the logic for our deletion operation in here. First, you'll want to create a function within remove that finds the node we are trying to delete in the current tree. If the node is not present in the tree, remove should return null. Now, if the target node is a leaf node with no children, then the parent reference to it should be set to null. This effectively deletes the node from the tree. To do this, you will have to keep track of","the parent of the node we are trying to delete as well. It will also be useful to create a way to track the number of children the target node has, as this will determine which case our deletion falls under.","We will handle the second and third cases in the next challenges.

Removing a node like this produces two subtrees that are no longer connected to the original tree structure. How can we reconnect them? One method is to find the smallest value in the right subtree of the target node and replace the target node with this value. Selecting the replacement in this way ensures that it is greater than every node in the left subtree it becomes the new parent of but also less than every node in the right subtree it becomes the new parent of.","Once this replacement is made the replacement node must be removed from the right subtree. Even this operation is tricky because the replacement may be a leaf or it may itself be the parent of a right subtree. If it is a leaf we must remove its parent's reference to it. Otherwise, it must be the right child of the target. In this case, we must replace the target value with the replacement value and make the target reference the replacement's right child.","Instructions: Let's finish our remove method by handling the third case.

Instead, the path to a node represents a specific key. For instance, if we wanted to store the string code in a trie, we would have four nodes, one for each letter: c — o — d — e. Following that path through all these nodes will then create code as a string — that path is the key we stored. Then, if we wanted to add the string coding, it would share the first three nodes of code before branching away after the d. In this way, large datasets can be stored very compactly. In addition, search can be very quick because it is effectively limited to the length of the string you are storing. Furthermore, unlike binary trees a node can store any number of child nodes.","As you might have guessed from the above example, some metadata is commonly stored at nodes that hold the end of a key so that on later traversals that key can still be retrieved. For instance, if we added codes in our example above we would need some way to know that the e in code represents the end of a key that was previously entered. Otherwise, this information would effectively be lost when we add codes.","Instructions: Let's create a trie to store words.

This means that all levels of the tree are fully filled and if the last level is partially filled it is filled from left to right.","While binary heaps may be implemented as tree structures with nodes that contain left and right references, the partial ordering according to the heap property allows us to represent the heap with an array. The parent-children relationship is what we're interested in and with simple arithmetic we can compute the children of any parent and the parent of any child node.","For instance, consider this array representation of a binary max heap:","<code>[ 76, 63, 48, 42, 37, 6, 42, 22 ]</code>","The root node is the first element, 6. Its children are 22 and 30. If we look at the relationship between the array indices of these values, for index i the children are 2 * i + 1 and 2 * i + 2. Similarly, the element at index 0 is the parent of these two children at indices 1 and 2. More generally, we can find the parent of a node at any index with the following: i - 1 / 2. These patterns will hold true as the binary tree grows to any size. Finally, we can make a slight adjustment to make this arithmetic even easier by skipping the first element in the array. Doing this creates the following relationship for any element at a given index i:","Example Array representation: <code>[ null, 76, 63, 48, 42, 37, 6, 42, 22 ]</code>","An element's left child: i * 2","An element's right child: i * 2 + 1","An element's parent: i / 2","Once you wrap your head around the math, using an array representation is very useful because node locations can be quickly determined with this arithmetic and memory usage is diminished because you don't need to maintain references to child nodes.","Instructions: Here we will create a max heap. Start by just creating an insert method which adds elements to our heap. During insertion, it is important to always maintain the heap property. For a max heap this means the root element should always have the greatest value in the tree and all parent nodes should be greater than their children. For an array implementation of a heap, this is typically accomplished in three steps:","Add the new element to the end of the array.","If the element is larger than its parents, switch them.","Continue switching until the new element is either smaller than its parent or you reach the root of the tree.","Finally, add a print method which returns an array of all the items that have been added to the heap."],challengeSeed:["var MaxHeap = function() {","  // change code below this line","  // change code above this line","};"],tests:["assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof MaxHeap !== 'undefined') { test = new MaxHeap() }; return (typeof test == 'object')})(), 'message: The MaxHeap data structure exists.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof MaxHeap !== 'undefined') { test = new MaxHeap() } else { return false; }; return (typeof test.insert == 'function')})(), 'message: MaxHeap has a method called insert.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof MaxHeap !== 'undefined') { test = new MaxHeap() } else { return false; }; return (typeof test.print == 'function')})(), 'message: MaxHeap has a method called print.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof MaxHeap !== 'undefined') { test = new MaxHeap() } else { return false; }; test.insert(50); test.insert(100); test.insert(700); test.insert(32); test.insert(51); let result = test.print(); return ((result.length == 5) ? result[0] == 700 : result[1] == 700) })(), 'message: The insert method adds elements according to the max heap property.');"],type:"waypoint",releasedOn:"Feb 17, 2017",solutions:[],challengeType:1,translations:{}},{id:"587d825b367417b2b2512c8b",title:"Remove an Element from a Max Heap",description:["Now that we can add elements to our heap let's see how we can remove elements. Removing and inserting elements both require similar logic. In a max heap you will usually want to remove the greatest value, so this involves simply extracting it from the root of our tree. This will break the heap property of our tree, so we must reestablish it in some way. Typically, for a max heap this is done in the following way:","Move the last element in the heap into the root position.","If either child of the root is greater than it, swap the root with the child of greater value.","Continue swapping until the parent is greater than both children, or you reach the last level in the tree.","Instructions: Add a method to our max heap called remove.
